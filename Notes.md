# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing historical data of Tesla's stock prices and building a predictive model to forecast future prices using machine learning techniques.

## Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting Workflow

## **1. Data Wrangling**

- **Handle Missing Data**:
    
    - Check for missing values and impute them if necessary (e.g., forward fill for time-series data).
    
- **Data Type Conversion**:
    
    - Convert the `date` column to a datetime object for time-based analysis.
    
- **Sort by Date**:
    
    - Ensure the data is sorted chronologically to maintain time-series integrity.
    
- **Remove Duplicates**:
    
    - Check for and remove duplicate rows.
    

## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## **Date & Time-Based Analysis**

- **Trend Analysis**:
    
    - Plot stock prices over time to identify long-term trends (uptrend, downtrend, or sideways).
    
- **Seasonality Check**:
    
    - Analyze patterns based on months, quarters, or years to detect seasonality.
    
- **Day-of-Week Effect**:
    
    - Group returns by day of the week to check if certain days exhibit higher/lower returns.
    

## **Price Volatility & Risk Assessment**

- **Daily Returns**:
    
    - Compute daily returns: ((Close−Open)/Open)×100((Close−Open)/Open)×100.
    - Analyze the distribution of daily returns to measure volatility.
    
- **Rolling Volatility**:
    
    - Calculate rolling standard deviation (e.g., 7-day and 30-day) of returns.
    
- **Bollinger Bands**:
    
    - Compute upper and lower Bollinger Bands: 20 day SMA±2SD20 day SMA±2SD.
    
- **Price Gaps & Outliers**:
    
    - Identify days with sudden price jumps/drops or abnormal volume spikes.
    

## **Feature Relationships & Correlations**

- Analyze relationships between features using correlation matrices or pair plots.
- Investigate:
    
    - High vs. Low spread (daily volatility).
    - Close vs. Adjusted Close discrepancies (e.g., stock splits or dividends).
    - Volume vs. Price movements (e.g., does high volume correlate with large price changes?).
    

## **3. Feature Engineering**

## **Moving Averages & Trend Indicators**

- Compute short-term and long-term moving averages:
    
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA): e.g., 1010-day SMA, 5050-day SMA.
    - Exponential Moving Average (EMA): e.g., 1212-day EMA, 2626-day EMA.
    
- Detect "Golden Cross" and "Death Cross":
    
    - Golden Cross: 5050-day SMA crosses above 200200-day SMA (bullish signal).
    - Death Cross: 5050-day SMA crosses below 200200-day SMA (bearish signal).
    

## **Momentum Indicators**

- Relative Strength Index (RSI):
    
    - Measure momentum to identify overbought/oversold conditions.
    
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):
    
    - Use MACD line and signal line to detect trend reversals.
    

## **Volume Analysis**

- Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP):
    
    - Incorporate volume into price trends for intraday analysis.
    
- Detect volume spikes:
    
    - Identify days where volume is significantly higher than average.
    

## **Lag Features & Time Series Transformations**

- Create lagged features:
    
    - Lagged closing prices: t−1t−1, t−7t−7, t−30t−30 days.
    
- Rolling statistics:
    
    - Rolling mean and standard deviation over different windows (e.g., 77-day, 3030-day).
    

## **Cumulative Returns**

- Compute cumulative percentage change of stock price over time.

## **4. Model Preparation**

## Train-Test Split

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets while maintaining chronological order to avoid data leakage.

## Feature Scaling

- Normalize or standardize features like `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and `volume` for better model performance.

## **5. Modeling**

## Choose a Model

You can use various machine learning models depending on the complexity of your problem:

1. **Linear Regression**: For simple relationships between features.
2. **Tree-Based Models**:
    
    - Random Forest: Handles non-linear relationships well.
    - LightGBM/XGBoost: Efficient for large datasets with engineered features.
    
3. **Time-Series Models**:
    
    - ARIMA/SARIMA: For univariate time-series forecasting.
    - LSTM/GRU: Deep learning models specifically designed for sequential data.
    

## **6. Model Evaluation**

Evaluate your model using metrics like:

4. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
5. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
6. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
7. R-squared (R2R2) for regression models.
